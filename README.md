2D platformer game using Cocos2D JS

This is an exploration project to create a 2D platformer game using cocos2D-js. The aim of this project is to create an old-school 2D platformer game so the children now will experience the fun of old platformer games (secrets, difficulty, etc) with some improvements of course (Old platformer games have ridiculously difficulty right off the bat).  
Level designs are intended to use various levels from old games, thus the layout of level 1 of this game is similar to world 1-1 from Super Mario Bros.  
 
Feel free to fork this project, and improve the game, I would be happy if you design a new level and contribute to this project or even better, publish your own game. Just don't forget to tell me so I can try the game as well.  
 
If you want to try this game in your browser, you can try it right here: [Play Now!](http://davidkwan95.github.io/Ninja/Play)
